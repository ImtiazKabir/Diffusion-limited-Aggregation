  <canvas id="canvas" oncontextmenu="event.preventDefault()"></canvas>

  <div class="context">
    This is an implementation of
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion">
      Brownian motion
    </a>with
    <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion-limited_aggregation">
      Diffusion-limited Aggregation (DLA)
    </a><br>
    We have a lot of colloidal particles moving in brownian motion. In the very
    center of the canvas we have an ionized clump which is going to
    coagulate the moving particles when they come in contact and thus eventually
    form a larger ionized aggregate. <br><br>

    This implementation has been written entirely in C ðŸ˜Ž. With the power of
    Webassembly it has been possible to render it in an html canvas. <br>
    Source code can be found
    <a href = ""https://github.com/ImtiazKabir/Diffusion-limited-Aggregation>
    here </a>

    <br>
    <b> Press SPACE or click <i> on the canvas </i>
    to toggle the render of moving particles.</b>

    Wait patiently and enjoy! Thank you.
